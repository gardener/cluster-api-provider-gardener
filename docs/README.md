# Cluster-API provider for Gardener ☁️🌱

This provider allows you to manage Gardener clusters through the means of Cluster API.

It features two methods of deployment:
- **CAPI**: The classic way of deploying a provider to a CAPI management cluster.
- **KCP**: The KCP-aware way to run the controllers against a KCP server.

You can find the documentation for both deployment scenarios respectively:
- [CAPI](./docs/capi/README.md)
- [KCP](./docs/kcp/README.md)
